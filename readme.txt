== Changelog ==

= 2.4.0 =
* Parse multiple comma-separated PMIDs at once into an ordered list.
* Option to add references manually for Journals, Websites, or Books.
* Search PubMed from WordPress!
    * References from your search are displayed in a list similar to native PubMed and, if you find one you like, click it and it'll be inserted into your post.
* Add optional "Smart Bibliography" feature which, if enabled, allows you to...
    * Insert references directly to your bibliography without having to scroll down.
    * Insert references and inline citations in one step.
    * Choose from a visual list of references in your bibliography if you do not choose to add citations in one step.
* If Smart Bibliography not used, the last-occurring ordered list is automatically tagged with the HTML ID `abt-smart-bib` on load to allow for more reliable tooltip rendering.
* Details for nerds:
    * Full rewrite; a majority of which is using React by Facebook.
    * Speed improvements & resource minification.

Documentation improvements will be added within the next few days.

**Note:** Due to the magnitude of this update, there may be bugs that I have not encountered (although, I did test this pretty heavily).
If you run into any problems, have any questions, or experience a bug, please file an issue [here](https://github.com/dsifford/academic-bloggers-toolkit/issues).

A special thanks to @metallikat36 for the great suggestions that led directly to the features added in this update.

= 2.3.1 =
* Fix poor rendering of tooltip close icon on mobile.
* Increase size of toucharea for tooltip close icon on mobile.

= 2.3.0 =
* Tooltips on desktop and mobile given a much-needed facelift.
* Tooltips now appear above or below depending on page scroll position (prevents chopping).
* Tooltips on desktop given a close timer so that the user has time to click links in references.
* Peer review boxes now show a default silhouette photo if no photo attached.
* Bumped the z-index of the tooltips to fight against elements from other plugins overlapping (Please let me know if '20' is still not enough).

= 2.2.2 =
* Fix issue where tooltips on mobile wouldn't go away + better mobile tooltip rendering.

= 2.2.1 =
* Fix issue where peer reviews containing ordered lists would break the inline reference tooltips.

= 2.2.0 =
* **Breaking Change:** Support for Internet Explorer versions 9 and below ended. (Please upgrade your browser).
* jQuery removed entirely (network hog). Page load times should be modestly improved.
* Instead of inline citations taking you to the references on click, the individual references are now displayed inside a tooltip. I've found that dealing with return links was too cumbersome and time consuming.
* Inline citations now accepts a more natural format. For example, [cite num="1-3,5,8"] correctly cites references 1, 2, 3, 5, & 8. **Note:** Your bibliography **MUST** be an ordered list **AND** it must be the last ordered list in your blog post.
* Slow animations on all pages removed.
* Adjusted peer review metaboxes with a clearer delimiter so that they're easier to read.

= 2.1.0 =
* **Quick addition to previous update:** Added ability to open Formatted Reference and Inline Citation menus via keyboard shortcuts. (Ah, much nicer!)

= 2.0.0 =
* Updated plugin for WordPress 4.3
* **Feature Upgrade:** Formatted references are now generated and inserted on the fly. (Note: This feature is only compatible with modern browsers or Internet Explorer 10 or above. If you are using an earlier version of IE, there will be no change.)
* Removed ability to use DOI / PMCID for reference insertion due to overall unreliability.

= 1.1.3 =
* **Bugfix:** Fixed issue causing peer review dropdown boxes to be highlighted when clicked.
* Allow the input of 'a', 'em', and 'br' tags in background section for peer reviews.

= 1.1.2 =
* **Bugfix:** Fixed issue where citation anchor links were interfering with anchor links not created by this plugin.
* **Bugfix:** Fixed issue where users were unable to apply line breaks or simple html tags (<strong><i><a>) in peer review boxes.

= 1.1.1 =
* **Feature Release:** Integration with Google Tag Manager. Starting now, you can set up individual link click tracking via Google Analytics! Use this feature to track PDF downloads, page-views, form submits, or anything else you can think of!
* **Bugfix:** Issue causing some users' Peer Review Boxes to not be formatted correctly.
* **Bugfix:** Add default citation style.
* Add uninstall hook to cleanup plugin files from database in the unfortunate event that you decide to uninstall the plugin.
* General Performance Improvements.

= 1.1 =
* Fixed issue where post excerpt wouldn't show correctly. (Thanks Brent Thoma!)

= 1.0 =
* Initial stable release.
